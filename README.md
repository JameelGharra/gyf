## Project Overview
This project is a client-server file transfer system designed with strong security principles. It demonstrates end-to-end encryption to safeguard files during transmission and ensures data integrity. The aim of the project to simulate real-world secure communication protocols.

## Features
- Client-Server Architecture: Supports multiple clients interacting with the server.
- Secure Registration and Authentication: Ensures only valid users can access services.
Encryption:
- RSA for secure key exchange.
- AES for encrypting files during transfer.
- Checksum Verification: Confirms the integrity of transmitted files.
- Multi-threaded Server: Concurrently handles multiple clients.
- Persistent Storage: SQLite database to store user information and transferred files.

## Technologies Used
The server-side was implemented in Python, and used selectors to handle clients concurrently as well as cryptodome for cryptographic operations.
The client-side was implemented in C++, used boost for networking and CryptoPP for cryptography.

## Encryption Process: Asymmetric and Symmetric Keys
This project utilizes a **hybrid encryption model**, combining the strengths of **asymmetric (RSA)** and **symmetric (AES)** encryption. RSA is used during the **initial handshake** to exchange a secure session key, ensuring that sensitive data, such as the AES key, is transmitted safely.

Once the **AES key** is exchanged, all subsequent file transmissions are encrypted with AES, which offers high-speed encryption ideal for large files. This approach ensures both **security and efficiency**: RSA protects the key exchange from interception, while AES handles the actual file encryption to ensure fast, reliable data transfer.

Keys are generated dynamically during client-server communication. The client stores the private RSA key securely in the `priv.key` file, and the server uses the client‚Äôs public key to encrypt the AES session key. This **hybrid model** guarantees that even if the file transmission is intercepted, the attacker cannot decrypt it without the AES key, which is protected by RSA.

## File Chunking in Network File Transfer

### Why We Use File Chunking

File chunking is a crucial technique in network file transfer for several reasons:

1. **Memory Efficiency**: By breaking large files into smaller chunks, we can process and transfer data without loading the entire file into memory at once. This is particularly important for systems with limited RAM or when dealing with very large files.

2. **Network Reliability**: Smaller chunks are less likely to fail during transmission compared to sending an entire large file at once. If a chunk fails to send, only that chunk needs to be resent, not the entire file.

3. **Improved Performance**: Chunking allows for parallel processing and transfer of data. Multiple chunks can be sent simultaneously, potentially increasing overall transfer speed.

4. **Resume Capability**: If a transfer is interrupted, it can be resumed from the last successfully transferred chunk rather than starting over from the beginning.

5. **Progress Tracking**: Chunking makes it easier to track and display the progress of file transfers, as each chunk represents a measurable unit of progress.

### Chunk Size Considerations

In our implementation, we use a chunk size of 4096 bytes (4 KB). This choice is based on several factors:

```cpp
static constexpr size_t CHUNK_SIZE = 4096; // 4 KB for memory management efficiency
```

1. **Memory Page Size**: 4 KB aligns with the typical memory page size in many systems, which can lead to more efficient memory allocation and management.

2. **Network Packet Size**: While not exactly matching typical network MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) sizes, 4 KB chunks are small enough to fit within most network packets without fragmentation.

3. **Balance of Efficiency and Overhead**: 4 KB provides a good balance between reducing overhead (fewer chunks to manage) and maintaining the benefits of chunking (not too large to negate the advantages).

4. **File System Considerations**: Many file systems use block sizes that are multiples of 4 KB, making this chunk size efficient for reading from and writing to disk.

5. **Encryption Efficiency**: For encrypted transfers, 4 KB aligns well with common block sizes used in encryption algorithms, potentially reducing padding requirements.

**Client**: The main class that orchestrates the client-side operations. It uses NetworkManager for communication, ProtocolHandler for creating requests and parsing responses, and CryptoManager for encryption operations.

**NetworkManager**: Handles network communications, including establishing connections, sending requests, and receiving responses.

**ProtocolHandler**: A singleton class responsible for creating various types of requests and unpacking responses. It encapsulates the protocol-specific logic.

**CryptoManager**: Another singleton class that provides encoding, decoding, and encryption functions.

**Request (and its subclasses)**: Represent different types of requests that can be sent to the server, such as registration, sending public keys, reconnecting, and sending files.

**ResponseHeader**: Represents the header of a response received from the server.
